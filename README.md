BIOE 123: FERMENTOR PROJECT

January – March 2016

Team: Jonathan Deaton, Katie Donahue, Mark Kirollos

Project Description
In BIOE 123, teams of 2-3 students design and build an E. Coli fermentor. The fermentor must hold a culture of 200 mL, maintain a temperature of 37 ̊C ± 1 ̊C, provide adequate aeration and agitation, and display live plots of optical density for red and green light. In addition, each team conceives of an original requirement, that their fermentor must also meet. My team used a Raspberry Pi to allow remote monitoring and control of our fermentor via Wi-Fi. This project was presented at the 2016 Tau Beta Pi Engineering Showcase at Stanford University.
